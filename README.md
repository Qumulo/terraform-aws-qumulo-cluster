# terraform-aws-qumulo-cluster ![Build Status](https://codebuild.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/badges?uuid=eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWREYXRhIjoiSFdqMnlNRys1OEdDY3I5Y0tKLzdNRUtuZjNEY1NJbWNRSEk0eEdsYzNkc3dRcm1qR3BkaFpacWF2cy9sVjJHZXRpY1dFWS9GdXRZdFJ4K0lkVE1vZTJrPSIsIml2UGFyYW1ldGVyU3BlYyI6InF3TVg2UmY2d2JJYWJjbE4iLCJtYXRlcmlhbFNldFNlcmlhbCI6MX0%3D&branch=master)

Terraform Module which creates a Qumulo Cloud Cluster in AWS.

This is primarily meant to help in spinning up clusters and provides an alternate method to CloudFormation.

## Requirements

This module requires the [AWS Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws) `>= 2.53`

It also requires the AMI ID of the [Qumulo Cloud Software](https://qumulo.com/product/cloud-products/).
You can find AMIs for the Qumulo Cloud Software on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?page=1&filters=VendorId&VendorId=c35cf4f2-2f03-462f-9548-27863b37e609&searchTerms=Qumulo) =
or by [Contacting Qumulo Sales](http://discover.qumulo.com/cloud-calc-contact.html).

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to a release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`).

```hcl
module "qumulo_cluster" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/Qumulo/terraform-aws-qumulo-cluster.git?ref=master"
  ami_id            = "ami-0641894224608b956"  # us-west-2 Qumulo-Cloud-3.0.0.2-release-5tib
  cluster_name      = "QumuloFileCluster"
  instance_type     = "m5.8xlarge"
  node_count        = 4
  key_pair_name     = "admin_ssh_key"
  subnet_id         = "subnet-abcdef"
  secutiy_group_ids = ["sg-1234567"]
  tags              = {
    User = "jdoe"
    Department = "IT"
  }
}
```

__NOTE:__ This module does not support input values changing while preserving
data on the cluster. It is designed to ease launching and terminating whole
clusters at once, not to make changes to active clusters. Data loss will occur
on a deployed cluster if a plan apply recreates any of the nodes managed by the
module.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| ami_id | The AMI ID for the Qumulo Cloud Software you wish to deploy | string | - | yes |
| cluster_name | What to name the cluster | string | - | yes |
| instance_type | Desired EC2 Instance Type. | string | m5.8xlarge | no |
| key_pair_name | EC2 SSH key pair to ssh to the "admin" user | string | - | yes |
| node_count | Number of Nodes (min: 4, max: 100) | number | 4 | no |
| subnet_id | ID of VPC subnet you want to spawn the cluster in | string | - | yes |
| security_group_ids | List of security groups you want to attach to nodes | list(string) | - | yes |
| tags | Additional tags to add to instances | map(string) | {} | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| instance_ids | Ec2 instance ids of all nodes |
| private_ips | List of all private IPs for all nodes in cluster |
| public_ips | List of all public IPs for all nodes in cluster (this can be empty if your VPC setting is not to assign public IPs) |
| temp_admin_password | Password used to authenticate as admin on the WebUI |
